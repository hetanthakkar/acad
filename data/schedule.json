The conference aims to give talks that inspire and explore new futuristic ideas dealing with all the techs we enjoy from the React ecosystem such as **React.js, React Native, GraphQL, Relay, Universal apps, ReasonML, Webpack, inline CSS and more**.\n\nReactEurope is also a great occasion to socialize, meet new people and old friends, hack together, taste delicious food and have fun in the beautiful city of Paris.\n\n**Join us at ReactEurope Conf to shape the future of client-side, mobile and universal applications!**",

First, we'll start by building a GraphQL server, covering best practices for architecting your schema, error handling, and caching. You'll also be exposed to some advanced backend topics such as schema stitching.\n\nNext, we'll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client. We'll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to customize your own network interface through Apollo Link. We'll also dive into server-side rendering and building query components with React Apollo. Throughout the course of the workshop, you'll learn practical tips for using GraphQL in production from the engineers at Formidable Labs.\n\nThis workshop assumes participants have basic knowledge of GraphQL and intermediate knowledge of React.",

I'll talk about how we drew on 2D physics to make the confetti feel real.\n\nMake no mistake; while this talk straddles the line between engineering and UX design, this is very much a React talk.

Subtyping allows runtime values of some type to be used as a different type, and how a language designer chooses to address subtyping deeply affects every other design decision in the language. From the way values are represented in the runtime, to how effective type inference algorithms are, to the supported polymorphic code patterns. Implicit runtime subtyping is common in today’s most popular languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby but the tradeoffs aren’t well understood. Subtyping is useful, but in today’s programming environment subtyping is overrated.",

We launched Croatian in May with little overhead beyond setting up the new domain and translating phrases. However, this was not true for all new languages; our next most requested language, Hebrew, posed a unique challenge. Because it reads right-to-left, the entire Hebrew UI must be flipped. Browsers only handle reversing the DOM structure, but styling and interactions must be coded manually.\n\nThis talk covers the journey of enabling right-to-left languages on airbnb.com. Recently, Airbnb has moved to a React frontend and away from Sass to a CSS-in-JS paradigm. We developed a performant and cross-browser solution for RTL that leveraged a CSS-in-JS abstraction layer to isolate the logic from our codebase. Our efforts led us most of the way to launching in Arabic and Hebrew while requiring little effort from our product engineers and with minimal disruption to their work.",

But runtime type systems can do many more things than just data validation.\nBecause they are very flexible (as you can basically reuse the entire hosting language to express your types) it will be much less likely that you will run into structures that cannot be expressed in the type system. You can generate runtime types on the fly from other sources (json-schema, graphql etc) or compose them together.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through some runtime type systems, like prop-types, tcomb and mobx-state-tree. But also show you how runtime- and compile-time typesystems like TypeScript or Flow can co-exist and leverage each other.\n\nIf you thought so far Higher Order Components or render callbacks where cool, in this talk I will show you that these patterns can be applied in general to any datastructure you have.",

I quickly figured out that it was a bot job and I started to look for a solution to do it. I found tons of projects but none of them matched my needs, so I decided to create my library.\n\nI called it SVGR. The goal was simple, transforming a SVG into a React component. I coded it and I solved my problem, I saved a lot of time! I wanted to make it open source so I took the time to make a \"beautiful\" logo with a lion emoji and a good README. I also integrated Prettier in the project, I wanted to have a nice React code output out of the box. I tweeted it and got 40 stars and one contribution, I was happy.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Christopher Chedeau tweeted about my library, two hours later React Europe also tweeted it, later that day I got a star from Dan Abramov. Next thing you know I was trending on GitHub, getting 1K stars in one day!\n\nWhat is the future for SVGR?",

Subtyping allows runtime values of some type to be used as a different type, and how a language designer chooses to address subtyping deeply affects every other design decision in the language. From the way values are represented in the runtime, to how effective type inference algorithms are, to the supported polymorphic code patterns. Implicit runtime subtyping is common in today’s most popular languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby but the tradeoffs aren’t well understood. Subtyping is useful, but in today’s programming environment subtyping is overrated.",

You can generate runtime types on the fly from other sources (json-schema, graphql etc) or compose them together.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through some runtime type systems, like prop-types, tcomb and mobx-state-tree. But also show you how runtime- and compile-time typesystems like TypeScript or Flow can co-exist and leverage each other.\n\nIf you thought so far Higher Order Components or render callbacks where cool, in this talk I will show you that these patterns can be applied in general to any datastructure you have.",

While it's design's job to give us static mock-ups, it's our job to bring those designs to life.\n\nFor example, at Khan Academy, we fill the user's screen with confetti rain when they get 100% correct on an exercise. I'll talk about how we drew on 2D physics to make the confetti feel real.\n\nMake no mistake; while this talk straddles the line between engineering and UX design, this is very much a React talk. I'll show how to abstract motion and whimsical behaviour into reusable components, and how to do SVG/canvas animation in a React-friendly way. I'll tear down some of my favourite examples from across the web, and show how to implement them in React.",

We launched Croatian in May with little overhead beyond setting up the new domain and translating phrases. However, this was not true for all new languages; our next most requested language, Hebrew, posed a unique challenge. Because it reads right-to-left, the entire Hebrew UI must be flipped. Browsers only handle reversing the DOM structure, but styling and interactions must be coded manually.\n\nThis talk covers the journey of enabling right-to-left languages on airbnb.com. Recently, Airbnb has moved to a React frontend and away from Sass to a CSS-in-JS paradigm. We developed a performant and cross-browser solution for RTL that leveraged a CSS-in-JS abstraction layer to isolate the logic from our codebase. Our efforts led us most of the way to launching in Arabic and Hebrew while requiring little effort from our product engineers and with minimal disruption to their work.",

I quickly figured out that it was a bot job and I started to look for a solution to do it. I found tons of projects but none of them matched my needs, so I decided to create my library.\n\nI called it SVGR. The goal was simple, transforming a SVG into a React component. I coded it and I solved my problem, I saved a lot of time! I wanted to make it open source so I took the time to make a \"beautiful\" logo with a lion emoji and a good README. I also integrated Prettier in the project, I wanted to have a nice React code output out of the box. I tweeted it and got 40 stars and one contribution, I was happy.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Christopher Chedeau tweeted about my library, two hours later React Europe also tweeted it, later that day I got a star from Dan Abramov. Next thing you know I was trending on GitHub, getting 1K stars in one day!\n\nWhat is the future for SVGR?",
