### Decision table

<!--
  The difference between feature request and enhancements might seem subtle. To
  help you with that, read and check all the boxes to make sure you're not
  asking for a feature request.
  
  IF YOU LEAVE AT LEAST ONE BOX UNCHECKED, YOU SHOULD INSTEAD OPEN A FEATURE
  REQUEST HERE: https://git.io/JJCeo

- [ ] The change I am requesting is not a new prop
- [ ] The change I am requesting does not provide support for a HTML element,
  attribute, CSS rule or anything related to HTML and CSS standards
- [Â ] The change I am requesting  does not provide support for a React Native
  feature
